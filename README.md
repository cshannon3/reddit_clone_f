# reddit_clone_f

A __somewhat__ functional clone of the BaconReader Reddit App using the reddit API and flutter.

**Purpose**
A fun experiment to get more practice working with APIs and creating dynamic interfaces.

**Interesting Parts**
- I integrated the reddit plugin with a Bloc state management
- I created a datamodel to handle the nesting of comments within each other
- I added scroll animations similar to baconreader.

**Unfinished / Broken Parts**
- I didn't include a sign-in screen
